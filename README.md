# Overview of Projects
##### Project:
Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius,
Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program should allow the user to
input a temperature in one scale and output the converted
temperature in another scale
##### Output:

##### Objective:
The main objective of this program is to develop a simple program that can easily convert the temperature from one scale to another scale.
Example:Celsius to Fahrenheit
##### Formula used:
* Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = (9/5)C + 32.
* Celsius to Kelvin: Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15
* Kelvin to Celsius: Celsius=kelvin-273.15
* Fahrenheit to Celsius:C=(F-32)*5/9
* Fahrenheit to Kelvin:kelvin=((fahrenheit-32)*5/9)+273.15
* Kelvin to Fahrenheit:fahrenheit=1.8*(kelvin-273.15)+32;
##### Technologies Used:
* C++:C++ is an object oriented programming(OOP) language that is viewedby many as the best language for creating large scale applications.
* Visual Studio:It is the software were the coding is done.
##### Conclusion:
This project is very helpful in converting temperature from one scale to another.
